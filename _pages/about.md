**About me**

Currently, I am a Software Developer at [kiutra GmbH](https://kiutra.com/), where I design and deploy scalable control software for cryogenic systems. Previously, I completed my Master of Science in Informatics at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, conducting research under the supervision of **Prof. [cite_start]Dr. Matthias Althoff**[cite: 9, 17]. There, I worked on self-supervised learning algorithms to generalize inverse kinematics across arbitrary serial kinematic chains.

**Research**

Robot adaptability in unstructured environments remains a critical barrier for flexible automation. [cite_start]My research focuses on **Robot-adaptive Neural Inverse Kinematics**, aiming to eliminate the need for robot-specific models or pre-computation.

[cite_start]By leveraging **self-supervised learning** and **reinforcement learning**, I investigate methods to generate diverse, collision-aware solutions for manipulators with varying degrees of freedom (2-6 DOF)[cite: 18, 35]. [cite_start]This work enables manipulators to operate effectively in complex, unseen environments, streamlining the deployment of modular robotic assemblies[cite: 19, 26].

If you are interested in my work on robot morphology optimization or neural kinematics, feel free to browse my [projects](/projects/) or reach out via email.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
