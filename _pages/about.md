**About me**

With a Master's in Informatics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I have developed a deep specialization in the mathematical foundations of AI and their applications in robotics. My academic focus ranged from core theoretical concepts to the latest research trends in these fields.

For my Master's thesis, "Robot-adaptive Neural Inverse Kinematics", I tackled self-supervised learning and modular robotics. My prior experience also includes reinforcement learning and computer vision in robotics. This work helped develop expertise and supported my passion for building intelligent systems that interact with the real world.

Beyond my core focus on research, I am currently working as a software developer. My professional experience spans frontend frameworks (React, Next.js) and backend engineering (Python), complemented by strong DevOps skills in Docker, Proxmox, Redis, and cloud infrastructure.

I am actively pursuing opportunities to leverage my robotics and deep-learning knowledge in academia. I am now looking to leverage this unique intersection of high-level AI research and practical system architecture to contribute to cutting-edge projects in robotics and intelligent automation.

<!-- Currently, I am a Software Developer at [**kiutra GmbH**](https://kiutra.com/), where I design, develop, and deploy scalable UI-based control software for cryogenic systems. I completed my Master of Science in Informatics at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, with a focus on machine learning, robotics, scientific computing, and high performance computing. My time there was defined by extensive research projects, where I gained experience in applying deep learning, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised learning algorithms to the domain of robotics.
    

**Research Interests**

Robot adaptability in unstructured environments remains a critical barrier for flexible automation. [cite_start]My research focuses on **Robot-adaptive Neural Inverse Kinematics**, aiming to eliminate the need for robot-specific models or pre-computation.

[cite_start]By leveraging **self-supervised learning** and **reinforcement learning**, I investigate methods to generate diverse, collision-aware solutions for manipulators with varying degrees of freedom (2-6 DOF)[cite: 18, 35]. [cite_start]This work enables manipulators to operate effectively in complex, unseen environments, streamlining the deployment of modular robotic assemblies[cite: 19, 26].
